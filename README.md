# Predicting-March-Madness
Finding the optimal algorithm that gives the best results to get the perfect march madness bracket each year improved. (Started 2022)

### Introduction

Coming up with an algorithm or program that can precisely predict the march madness bracket is practically impossible. The way I approached the problem was using random chance as well as looking at one predictor variable that seems most trivial to analyzing basketball game wins. The seed of the team. Personally, I don't watch any college basketball or closely follow the teams that play each year, thus, we will just use prior data and statistics to determine which team advances. For the bracket submittions I manually entered them into NCAA's and ESPN's official march madness websites (with 10 and 25 entries respectively). This gives us 35 total tries each year to hopefully achieve the perfect bracket.

The chances getting a perfect bracket is one in 9.2 quintillion, with random choice. We can certainly beat this. However, "...researchers using statistical methods have only reliably picked about 70 percent of the games correctly, making the probability of a perfect bracket one in 5.7 billion" (news4jax). This is what we will focus on trying to match or beat. We wish we can achieve a perfect bracket but we should be realistic and aim for a goal we can beat. Since even experts are unable to accomplish this task, the program must have a lot of perfect random luck.

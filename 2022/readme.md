# March 2022

The start of the journey to find the perfect march madness bracket.

### Info

The first year that I am predicting the bracket, there are many predictors that many basketball experts use (e.g. shot percentage, average points scored against, etc), however, this program will look at the teams seed. In hindsight, I could improve and analyze more predictors in the future that are significant.

### Bracket Statistics



### Conclusion and Overview

I followed the first couple days of the performance of my brackets and saw a lot of inconsistencies. Some brackets did suprisingly well 99%+ while most had performances under 50%. This is expected. As long as we can predict one correct bracket we are happy.
